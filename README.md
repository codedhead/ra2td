A Tower Defense game that I made back in my sophomore year, when I was learning event-driven programming in Windows.

I wrote the game engine following the book [Beginning Game Programming] by Michael Morrison, all the resources used in the game were extracted from the Red Alert 2. Since I don't own those images and sounds, I haven't included them here.
